  <h4><b>Access To The Content</b></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Access by Authorized Users of an Institutional Subscriber shall be governed by these Terms and Conditions of Use and any
      license agreement between the Press and the Institutional Subscriber. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and
      Conditions of Use and the license agreement, the latter shall prevail.</li>
    <li>Institutional Subscribers are responsible for undertaking reasonable measures to prevent access by unauthorized persons
      to authorized IP addresses, and are responsible for terminating any unauthorized access of which the institution has actual
      notice or knowledge. Institutional Subscribers will not be held responsible for unauthorized use of the Content provided (i)
      such use is without the express or implied consent of the Institutional Subscriber; (ii) the Institutional Subscriber promptly
      notifies the Press of any such use of which it becomes aware; and (iii) the Institutional Subscriber takes all reasonable steps
      to terminate such activity promptly. The Press reserves the right to deny access immediately if unauthorized use is detected or
      suspected; however, denial of access will be limited, to the extent practicable, to the IP address(es) from which the activity
      originated. The Press agrees to notify promptly the Institutional Subscriber of any denial of access; to cooperate with the
      Institutional Subscriber in terminating such activity; and to restore access to the affected IP address(es) within one business
      day of successful resolution of the situation. Failure to take reasonable steps to terminate unauthorized activity within thirty
      (30) days of notice from the Press of such activity or repeated usage violation from the authorized IP addresses of the
      Institutional Subscriber may result in suspension or termination of access.</li>

      access to the Journal are for the personal use of the subscriber or society member and may not be shared.</li>
    <li>The Press reserves the right to deny access to a username or password immediately if unauthorized use is detected or
      suspected, and to use its best efforts to notify the subscriber or society member of any denial of access. The Press agrees
      to restore access to the username and password within one business day of successful resolution of the situation.</li>
    <li>The Press website will meet the generally accepted requirements of W3C AA and U.S. federal Section 508 accessibility
      standards. The Press and its platform provider Atypon are not responsible for maintaining third-party software integrated
      into the website for accessibility compatibility. Certain accessibility requirements for W3C AA and Section 508 are subject
      to interpretation and the interpretation of Atypon shall in all such cases be the accepted interpretation for the purpose of
      accessibility compliance. Upon request, Atypon will provide references to Institutional Subscribers and resources that can
      provide a site accessibility audit. Institutional Subscribers have the right to adapt the Content for its Authorized Users
